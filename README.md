# amole-guacamole

 simple telegram bot to handle inquiries from customers and to handle payments for their requests. The purpose is to compile data from the customers into a set message format that will be sent to myself, the bot operator. This will then be reviewed and forwarded onward if required.

There will only be two options and this can be seen from the attached logic tree. The first option is for the incoming requests from customers. The second will be used for customer messages to the bot operator/administrator.

The first option will collect about 5 pieces of user input data (4 text options, one check box option), receive payment from the user, then to give the user a reference number, and then to arrange all the data into the example format and have the data forwarded to the bot owner in the example given at the end. Refer to logic tree diagram for clarification.
